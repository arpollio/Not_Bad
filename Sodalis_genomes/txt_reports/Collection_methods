Mauve Alignment
Mauve is a progressive aligner uses specifically an anchored aligning approach. It pairs an exact string
as an anchor to then match syntenic regions. By using genbank files it becomes possible to verify the presents or absence
or specifically conserved syntenic region. I used Sodalis praecaptivus as the references. I then includeded the known
sodalis clade organisms as well as organisms that are present within a like host.

Small reduced genomes lack any significant paired regions. Non-sodalis clade organisms did not align easily due to the lack
on long conserved strings of characters. As a wide brush of the data set this is a great first step to identify specific syntenic
regions within these genomes.

Kegg search
I was able to verify the genome ID on the front page of specific organism pages. I then could simply search for genes within the
FliE-R operon.

I have a file with the gene accession numbers from NCBI AND a file that has +/- information for each gene. by keeping this
information separated allows for quick analysis and simplifies the fasta acquisition for each gene.

BLAST Verification
Organisms were then searched using the progressive alignment software BLASTx, protein input searching for nucleotide output,
to unarguably verify the presents or absence of any specific gene. Results were collected by location within the genome,
And presents absence were collected the same way they were for the KEGG search.
